This is a [RPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)-based calculator that I wrote as my first project while learning [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) in school.

It supports basic arithmetic as well as trig and other functions. You can choose a fixed number of decimal places or switch to scientific notation. The boxes on the right show the contents of the calculators four registers.

I also added an intro and start screen with what at the time seemed like fancy transitions.
